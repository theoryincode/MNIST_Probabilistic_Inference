# MNIST_Probabilistic_Inference
Classification of MNIST handwritten digits by probabilistic inference using Monte Carlo on BÃ©zier paths.
--
Templates for handwritten digits are modelled using Bezier paths (or strokes). These paths are morphed onto the digits of the MNIST database; probabilistic inference will allow classification.

This approach roughly follows ideas from J. Tenenbaum et al. (see http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html, esp. "Human-level concept learning...") and others. 

It's really a fun exercise, as understanding how much common sense we as humans put into things like character recognition without even realizing - which makes appropriate algorithm design quite hard ;-) Furthermore, it is to some extend also a "back to square one" experience, as I find myself digging through stuff like the following, to get some nice templates for Bezier path fitting:
