# MNIST_Probabilistic_Inference

Classification of MNIST handwritten digits by probabilistic inference using Monte Carlo on BÃ©zier paths.

Templates for handwritten digits are modelled using Bezier paths. These paths are morphed onto the digits of the MNIST database; probabilistic inference will allow classification.

Under construction, as this is just a little side project of mine.
